    %p Most of the people already know how these sorts of networks already work. You have a profile and other users (or even anonymous people without accounts) can ask you any question to find out more about you, so can you do the same with others. Finding friends with the same interests, people that share your opinion (and people that probably don't), you can find everything here!

      But what makes

      special?
    %p
      = APP_CONFIG['site_name']
      tries to take aspects from other popular or now gone platforms and combine them to get the best result possible. Also, we take in the ideas and feedback of our community so we can build a service that's even closer to being exactly the service people want to use!
